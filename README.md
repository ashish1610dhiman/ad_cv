## üìñ Research Experience

**Research Intern** @ University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand _(May 2019 ‚Äî Jul 2019)_ <br>
[Professor Stephen Cranefield, Department of Information Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/info-science/about/stephen-cranefield.html)
  - Researched on a novel approach to learn arbitrarily complex Norms from a Normative Language, expressed as a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar(PCFG), in the setting of Multi-Agent Societies. Paper published in proceedings of [IJCAI‚Äô21](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/17).
  - Modeled Norms as expressions from a recursive grammar space (PCFG) and applied Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
technique to sample the posterior distribution of Candidate Norms, by observing a task under a True Norm.
  - Formulated an approach to analyse the convergence of MCMC chains, by transposing the expressions from the grammar to instances from tree kernels, which allowed for the calculation Gelman Rubin RÀÜ convergence statistic measure.
  - **_Technologies used:_** Python, Bayesian Learning, MCMC, Tree Kernels.
<br><br>


**Bachelor‚Äôs Dissertation** @ IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal, India _(Aug 2018 ‚Äî May 2019)_ <br>
[Professor Sujoy Bhattacharya, Vinod Gupta School of Management, IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/BM/faculty/bm-sujoybtc)
  -  Examined Enhanced Index Tracking (EIT), a class of Optimal Portfolio Selection problems, and modified the heuristic
Kernel Search framework to improve the return per unit risk performance by 12% over the vanilla Kernel Search method.
  - Formulated the EIT as a Mono-Objective Linear optimisation, leveraging a weighted Risk & Return objective function.
  - Used the dimension-reduction strategies of Nonnegative Principal Component Analysis (NPCA) and Nonnegative Matrix factorisation (NMF), to emphasize the long-run performance of securities while suppressing the short-term noise.
  - **_Technologies used:_** Python, R, Linear & Convex Optimisation, NMF/NPCA, Kernel Search Methods.
