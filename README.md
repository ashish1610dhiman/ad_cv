## Objective
To expand my Data Science knowledge base and gain expertise in **Optimisation Methods and Explainable Machine Learning** and be at the forefront of research in the said domains. The skill-set and networking connections developed during my graduate education will help me land applied research roles in coveted firms. Working with top minds from across the world would hone my technical skills, and access to varied perspectives shall help me evolve and broaden my mindset, eventually allowing me to make progress on my start up idea on mental health.

## 👩🏼‍🎓 Education

**Indian Institue of Technology, Kharagpur**  _(Jul 2015 - May 2019)_ <br>
B.Tech(Honours) in Aerospace Engineering, with Micro Specialisation in Optimisation Theory | CGPA 8.32/10


<br>

## 📖 Research Experience

**Research Intern** @ University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand _(May 2019 — Jul 2019)_ <br>
[Professor Stephen Cranefield, Department of Information Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/info-science/about/stephen-cranefield.html)
  - Researched on a novel approach to learn arbitrarily complex Norms from a Normative Language, expressed as a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar(PCFG), in the setting of Multi-Agent Societies. Paper published in proceedings of [IJCAI’21](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/17).
  - Modeled Norms as expressions from a recursive grammar space (PCFG) and applied Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
technique to sample the posterior distribution of Candidate Norms, by observing a task under a True Norm.
  - Formulated an approach to analyse the convergence of MCMC chains, by transposing the expressions from the grammar to instances from tree kernels, which allowed for the calculation Gelman Rubin Rˆ convergence statistic measure.
  - **_Technologies used:_** Python, Bayesian Learning, MCMC, Tree Kernels.
<br><br>


**Bachelor’s Dissertation** @ IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal, India _(Aug 2018 — May 2019)_ <br>
[Professor Sujoy Bhattacharya, Vinod Gupta School of Management, IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/BM/faculty/bm-sujoybtc)
  -  Examined Enhanced Index Tracking (EIT), a class of Optimal Portfolio Selection problems, and modified the heuristic
Kernel Search framework to improve the return per unit risk performance by 12% over the vanilla Kernel Search method.
  - Formulated the EIT as a Mono-Objective Linear optimisation, leveraging a weighted Risk & Return objective function.
  - Used the dimension-reduction strategies of Nonnegative Principal Component Analysis (NPCA) and Nonnegative Matrix factorisation (NMF), to emphasize the long-run performance of securities while suppressing the short-term noise.
  - **_Technologies used:_** Python, R, Linear & Convex Optimisation, NMF/NPCA, Kernel Search Methods.

## 👩🏼‍💻 Work Experience

**Assistant Manager** @ American Express India, Gurgoan, India _(Aug 2021 — Present)_ <br>
[Consumer Collection Deciscion Science, Credit and Fraud Risk](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/careers/career-areas/risk-and-data-analytics/?intlink=us-amex-career-en-us-careerArea-Analytics)
  - Envisaged and implemented a novel domain of information source by transforming the trade level supplementary and joint account linkages present on the Experian bureau’s end to create an inter-customer linkage relationship graph.
  - Leveraged the inter-customer relationship graph to create modeling attributes based on primary and secondary linkages, helping prevent annual credit default of $2.5 million, along with better identification of Credit Bust Out(CBO) fraud.
  - Implemented and Investigated the appropriateness of two feature selection algorithms, namely Gradient Boosted Feature Selection(GBFS) and min Redundancy and Maximum Relevance(mRMR), for application in Credit Risk context.
  - **_Technologies used:_** Python, Spark, SQL, AWS, GBDT, SAS.

**Risk Analyst** @ American Express India, Gurgoan, India _(Jul 2019 — Jul 2021)_ <br>
[Consumer Collection Deciscion Science, Credit and Fraud Risk](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/careers/career-areas/risk-and-data-analytics/?intlink=us-amex-career-en-us-careerArea-Analytics)
  - Implemented a Payment Relief model, on Experian’s end, to identify customers enrolled in Covid-19 Payment Relief programs of external Creditors, by using tradeline level history of monthly balances, payments and account status codes.
  - Developed an automated pipeline to, parse risk triggers from the Bureau related to External Covid Relief Programs, generate an MIS report, and share it with the leaders in real time, with the anomalous sections highlighted.
  - Improved the accuracy of dollar predictions of External Payments model by 7%, through implementing Synthetic Minority Over sampling technique(SMOTE), for people with actual payment reports available.
 - **_Technologies used:_** Python, Spark, SQL, AWS, GBDT, SAS.
